        <p>
            I believe nfts and web3 technology have a bright future in the Gaming
            industry. This is a really simple unity project, you need to sign in 
            with a metamask wallet but it will bring you to a blank page. Only if 
            you own any of the nfts listed on the nft marketplace from above 
            it will show the game object. If you want to try with different wallets
            you'll have to manually logout from metamask in "â‹®" -> connected sites . 
        </p>

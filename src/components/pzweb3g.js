        <p>
            I believe nfts and web3 technology have a bright future in the Gaming
            industry. This is a really simple unity project, you need to sign in 
            with a metamask wallet but it will bring you to a blank page. Only if 
            you own any of the nfts listed on the nft marketplace from above 
            it will show the game object. 
        </p>

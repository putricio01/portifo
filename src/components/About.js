            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am passionate about the web3 industry. I first got involved in crypto a few years ago
                because of trading, ever since then i've been learning about the technology behind it.
                I have a decent understanding of how a Web3 dapp is buit. I feel confident writing in 
                Javascript and Solidity,i work using tools and libraries like web3.js, ethers.js, Next.js, 
                hardhat, foundry, moralis, openzeppellin contracts and static analyzers like slither, or  
                Mythril. I'm also into security auditing. I've completed some Damm Voulnerable Defi and 
                Ethernaut challenges I've read about solidity design patterns and common solidity exploits.
                I know the basics of html and css for the frontend.
